#Answer the following in comments inside your application script:

#What was your level of comfort with the lesson/application?
 #1) It was all new to me, but not too bad!
#Approximately how long did you work on this lesson?
 #2) Maybe 2 hours or so?
#What areas of the lesson/application confused or still confuses you?
 #3) Nothing right now!
#What are some things you would like to know more about that is related to,
#but not covered in, this lesson?
 #4) NA right now, I've really needed assistance with multipaneling for thesis work, so this is helpful!
